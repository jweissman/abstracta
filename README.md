# Abstracta

Cellular automata game :)

The idea is to have a game server where different players' organisms
could interact...


# Dependencies

You will need to

  brew install sdl2 libogg libvorbis

for Gosu's dependencies. Then bundle and rake to play.

Ideally we'll get vagrant setup to build a dev environment for us...

(Eventually we'll want to containerize the server application too, 
although that can be headless... A containerized dev environment
makes sense eventually too once that is reified a bit further. Something
like boxen may not be the worst thing to think about eventually there too.)
